Scribd-Downloader
=================

|Build Status|

-  This python script allows downloading of Scribd documents.

-  It does not matter if the pages are blurred or require
   authentication, this script will still do the job.

-  There are two types of documents on Scribd:

-  Documents made up using a collection of images and
-  Actual documents where the text can be selected, copied etc.

This script takes a different approach to both of them:

-  Documents consisting of a collection of images is straightforward and
   this script will simply download the induvidual images which can
   later be combined into a PDF using a suitable software. Simple.

-  Actual documents where the text can be selected are hard to tackle.
   If you feed such a document in this script, only the text present in
   document will be downloaded. I do not know much about JS and since
   Scribd uses JS to combine text and images for each induvidual page, I
   do not yet know how they do it. Ideas welcome on combining images and
   text!

Installation
------------

::

    pip install scribd-downloader

(Text will be saved side by side in a ``.txt`` file in your current
working directory)

-  To download document containing images; use the ``--images`` option (the tool cannot figure out this on its own):
